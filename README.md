## Description
This project experiments with the Burau representation of the braid group. The projects provides codes to determine if a matrix over the ring of Laurent polynomials has all real and/or positive eigenvalues in the field of Puiseux series with real coefficients. Using these codes, we investigate genericity of real eigenvalues in the image of the Burau representations in the random walk model.
