## Description

This project experiments with the Burau representation of the braid group. The project provides codes to determine if a matrix over the ring of Laurent polynomials has all real and/or positive eigenvalues in the field of Puiseux series with real coefficients. Using these codes, we investigate genericity of real eigenvalues in the image of the Burau representations in the random walk model.  

## Summary of results

### Observation

There are reducible and pA braids that does not have all real eigenvalues. 

> The reducible braid (2, -1, -2, 1, -3, -2) does not have all real eigenvalues.
>
> The eigenvalues are ${1,\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{2t},\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2t} }$ counted with multiplicity. 



> The pA braid (-1, -3, -3, -1, -2, -3) does not have all real eigenvalues
